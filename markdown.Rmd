# Purpose of Script

If you are looking to process larger volumes of ARU recording data for acoustically active species, this is the place to be. The point of this protocol is to provide an open access and easily personalizable series of scripts for visualy identifying and/or counting mid-frequency wildlife. 

# Steps 

1) Evaluate files
2) Produce acoustic indices
3) Evaluate indices visually
4) Produce recording visualizations and metadata
5) Process recordings visually


# Scripts

0_Recording_assessment_metadata_setup.R
- Here you are simply visualizing the list of the recordings you have
- Make sure that you save a copy of this list of files and file sizes, especially if there are a number of them (it will take a while)
- This output is merely reference for future scripts, but can be used to sort files you don't want to include in various steps


1_rename_and_copy_recordings.R
- This is an essential step for the PowerShell script. you need to be able to reference the timezone in your filename for the powershell script to work
- If you are running this on non-continuous recordings, this step can also be used to 'fake' a continuous recording schedule
